Rubik's Cube Visual Solver
A browser-based Rubik's Cube simulator and solver built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This interactive project allows users to scramble a virtual 3×3 Rubik’s Cube and visualize its step-by-step solving process.

Features
2D Cube Representation: The cube is rendered as a flat 2D layout using color codes.

Manual Rotation Logic: Implements face rotations (U, D, L, R, F, B) using string manipulation.

Random Scrambling: Applies a random sequence of valid moves to scramble the cube.

Step-by-Step Solving: Reverses the scramble sequence with animation delays to visually demonstrate each step.

Fully Client-Side: No dependencies; runs entirely in the browser.

Getting Started
1. Clone or Download
Save the HTML file or clone the repository (if applicable).

2. Open in Browser
Simply open the index.html file in any modern browser.

Usage
Click Scramble to apply a random sequence of moves.

Click Solve to animate the reverse of the scramble.

Click Show to refresh the current cube view.

Technology
HTML

CSS (for basic layout and buttons)

Vanilla JavaScript (OOP approach to cube logic and animation)

Limitations
The solver is not optimal; it simply reverses the scramble sequence.

Cube is displayed as plain text instead of colored visual blocks.

Future Improvements
Add a color-block 2D or 3D view.

Implement an optimal solving algorithm like Kociemba’s.

Enable user-controlled manual moves.
