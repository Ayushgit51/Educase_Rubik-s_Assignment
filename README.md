# Rubik's Cube Visual Solver

A browser-based Rubik's Cube simulator and solver created using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## 🧩 Features

- **2D Cube Representation**: Displays cube faces as flat text with color codes.
- **Scramble Function**: Randomly scrambles the cube using standard face moves.
- **Step-by-Step Solving**: Solves the cube by reversing the scramble, showing each step with a delay.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Cube logic is implemented with a clean class-based structure.
- **Interactive Controls**: Buttons to scramble, solve, and refresh the cube display.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (ES6)

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Clone or Download** this repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Use the buttons provided:
   - `Scramble` to shuffle the cube.
   - `Solve` to reverse the scramble.
   - `Show` to re-render the current state.

## 📄 How It Works

- The cube is represented as a single 54-character string.
- Each move is a rotation of one face (U, D, L, R, F, B).
- Solving is done by applying the inverse of each scramble move (3 clockwise rotations).
- `getCubeSvg()` generates a simple visual layout of the cube for the browser.

## 📌 Limitations

- Does not guarantee the shortest solution (uses scramble reversal).
- Visuals are text-based (not graphical).
- Only works for scrambling generated by the app itself.

## 📈 Future Enhancements

- Add colored 2D or 3D cube rendering.
- Support user-defined moves and rotations.
- Implement optimal solving algorithms (e.g., Kociemba).
